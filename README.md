Project Description:

As we know that Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the weather conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction. In this paper, we predict energy prediction based on weather data and analyse the important parameters as well as their correlation on the energy output.
